Using BlockChain in Neural Network
Deep learning methods have become more and more advanced, and their needs for processing units is increasing. Thus, we aim to tackle this using blockchain technique and distribute the training procedure through a decentralized network.
This project is just the first part of the implementation of the BlockChain.
